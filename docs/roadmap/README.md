# Roadmap (volatile)

Everything in this folder is **planning material that is expected to change**:
milestones, implementation plans, task lists and open questions. Permanent
knowledge belongs in the [Web UI spec](../spec/web.md), the
[architecture docs](../architecture/overview.md) and the [ADRs](../adr/).

Backend milestones are in
[titan/docs/roadmap](https://github.com/vlukyanets/titan/blob/master/docs/roadmap/milestones.md).
Web UI milestones depend on them.

## Contents

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [milestones.md](milestones.md) | Web UI milestones in order, with their scope and exit criteria |
| `plans/` | One implementation plan per milestone or feature, created when work starts |

## Workflow

1. Pick the next milestone from [milestones.md](milestones.md).
2. Write `plans/<milestone>-<topic>.md`: the goal, the spec sections it
   implements, a design sketch and a task checklist.
3. Implement task by task. Tick tasks off in the plan in the same commits that
   complete them.
4. When the milestone is done, move any lasting knowledge into the permanent
   docs, mark the milestone done, and delete the plan. Git history keeps it.
